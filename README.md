# python-crewai

A lightweight project template for Python experiments.

## Getting Started

pre-commit install
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for coding conventions and additional guidelines.

=======
This repository contains the initial Python package layout for the `crewai` project. The
package currently exposes a basic skeleton for later expansion.

```
crewai/
    agents/
    tasks/
    tools/
```

Each subpackage includes an empty `__init__.py` file and a placeholder module that can be
extended with real functionality in the future.
