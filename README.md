# python-crewai

This repository contains the initial Python package layout for the `crewai` project. The
package currently exposes a basic skeleton for later expansion.

```
crewai/
    agents/
    tasks/
    tools/
```

Each subpackage includes an empty `__init__.py` file and a placeholder module that can be
extended with real functionality in the future.
